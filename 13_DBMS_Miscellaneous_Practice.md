# 13. DBMS Miscellaneous Topics & Interview Practice

---

## Other Important Topics

### 1. Triggers

- **Trigger:** A special procedure that automatically executes in response to certain events on a table (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
- **Use-cases:** Auditing, enforcing business rules, automatic updates.

**Example:**
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER update_timestamp
BEFORE UPDATE ON Student
FOR EACH ROW
SET NEW.updated_at = NOW();
```

---

### 2. Stored Procedures & Functions

- **Stored Procedure:** Precompiled SQL code that can be executed multiple times.
- **Function:** Similar, but returns a value and is often used in queries.

---

### 3. Cursors

- **Cursor:** Database object used to retrieve, manipulate, and navigate through a result set row by row.

---

### 4. Views vs. Materialized Views

- **View:** Virtual table, not storing data physically.
- **Materialized View:** Stores the result physically; needs refreshing.

---

### 5. Data Warehousing & OLAP

- **Data Warehouse:** Centralized repository for integrated data from multiple sources.
- **OLAP (Online Analytical Processing):** Tools for analyzing data in multiple dimensions (e.g., sales by region, time).

---

### 6. Backup & Recovery

- **Backup:** Copying data to prevent loss.
- **Recovery:** Restoring data after a failure.
