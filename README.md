- **Architecture & Models:** Overview of DBMS architectures, types, and data models.
- **ER Model:** Entities, relationships, ER diagrams, and mapping to relational schema.
- **Relational Model:** Schema, tuples, attributes, keys, and integrity constraints.
- **SQL:** DDL, DML, DCL, TCL‚Äîsyntax, examples, and best practices.
- **Joins, Subqueries & Views:** Different join types, subquery patterns, and view usage.
- **Normalization:** 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF, higher normal forms, and their importance.
- **Transactions & Concurrency:** ACID properties, transaction states, schedules, deadlocks.
- **Indexing & Query Optimization:** Types of indexes, hashing, query plans and optimization strategies.
- **Security & Authorization:** Privileges, authentication, SQL injection, RBAC, encryption.
